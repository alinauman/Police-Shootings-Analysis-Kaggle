# Police-Shootings-Analysis-Kaggle

The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. In 2015, The Post documented more than two times more fatal shootings by police than had been recorded by the FBI. Last year, the FBI announced plans to overhaul how it tracks fatal police encounters.
The task in hand is to analyze the police shootings.

The following three questions will be answered throught the implementation,
- What about rate of shootings
- What is the rate of killings relative to race and age
- Which states have the most kills

Every single step has been documented along the way.

The source of this data is Kaggle Public Datasets. The database includes every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer.
